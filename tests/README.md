# Tests

Compiler regression tests. Run the whole suite with:

```bash
cmake --build build          # make sure the compiler is current
tests/run.sh
```

`run.sh` exits non-zero if anything fails, so it is safe to use as a CI gate.
Override the compiler or C linker with `ESKIUC=...` / `CC=...`.

## How a test is judged

The runner classifies every file automatically. There is no list to maintain.

| Kind  | Files | Pass condition |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **run**   | `NAME.esk` **+** `NAME.expected` | compiles, links, runs, and stdout matches `NAME.expected` **exactly** |
| **smoke** | `NAME.esk` with no `.expected`   | compiles, links, and exits `0` (output not checked) |
| **error** | `errors/NAME.esk`                | `--test-typechecker` exits non-zero **and** the diagnostics contain the `EXPECT-ERROR:` substring from the file's first line |
| **lint**  | `warnings/NAME.esk`              | type-checks under `-Wall` and emits exactly the warnings named by its `// EXPECT-WARNING:` lines (none listed means none allowed) |

A `run` or `smoke` test may have a C companion `NAME.c` next to it. The runner compiles
it with `$CC` and links it into the test binary, which is how calls across the C ABI are
checked (`c_abi_struct.c`, `c_abi_try.c`, `c_abi_callback.c`, `c_abi_fnptr.c`,
`bitfield_c_layout.c`). Every test links through `eskiuc` with no `-l` flags, so the
libraries a program implies (`#pragma link`, the C++ runtime, pthread) are exercised too.

`run.sh` also runs the generated deep-input tests from `tests/deep/gen.sh`: a
100000-operand chain, 10000-deep nesting, and a program past the 100000-level nesting
limit that must be rejected.

These are *honest* tests: a `run` test fails the moment the generated program
prints anything different, and an `error` test fails if the compiler ever starts
**accepting** code it should reject. (Verified by deliberately corrupting an
expected file and by adding a compilable file under `errors/`: both make
`run.sh` exit 1.)

## Coverage

The runner needs no list, but this index keeps the suite legible. Keep it in sync
when you add a test.

| `async_basic` | `async`/`await` transform: one await of an already-ready future (fast path) |
| `async_io` | suspending await over a real reactor read; params live across the await |
| `async_multi` | multiple awaits (fast path); values thread through frame states |
| `async_multi_io` | two suspending awaits over the reactor (multi-state chain) |
| `async_return_await` | `return await E;` desugaring and `async void` (uint8 unit) |
| `async_cancel` | `future_drop` on a suspended async function: cascade-drop + free, no UAF |
| `async_loop` | `while` loop containing an await (read-until-EOF; loop back-edge) |
| `async_if` | `if`/`else` with an await in each branch (branch-join states) |
| `async_for` | C-style `for` loop containing an await |

| `async_frame_expr` | frame-hoisted locals used in a struct literal / index / call after an await are renamed to `fr.x` (shared child-enumeration) |

| `combinator_drop` | dropping an unresolved `select2`/`join2`/`select2v`/`join2v` drops its inputs (producers cancelled, wakers unhooked); nested timeout cancels an inner select |
| `net_no_sigpipe` | a send to a closed peer (`net_send`, `net_send_str`, `http_reply`, `net_write_async`) returns an error instead of raising SIGPIPE |
| `async_join` | generic `join2<A,B>`: await both futures, then read both values |
| `const_method` | A method declaring `const T* self` may be called on a const value. |
| `decl_repeats_ok` | Repeated top-level declarations that stay legal: a prototype before its definition, an `extern` declaration beside the variable's definition, and... |
| `enum_dup_value` | Classic enum members may share a value (as in C). A match is on the value, so one arm covers every member with that value. |
| `generic_ptr_leading` | A leading-star pointer to a generic struct instance (`*List<int>`, `*B<int>`) is a valid declared type, including one used only as an explicit... |
| `method_free_fn` | Method-call syntax on free-function methods (`Type_method(self, ...)`), including stdlib ones: `c.get()`, `s.trim()`, `n.push('!')`. |
| `nullable_narrow` | Null-narrowing forms for `?*T`: each dereference below is proven safe. |
| `return_flow` | Definite-return analysis: forms that always return are accepted. |
| `sema_accepts` | Valid forms next to the stricter checks: a lambda whose return type is reconciled to the declared one, an enum-member case label, a struct named... |
| `sizeof_var` | sizeof(variable) measures the variable's type (C semantics). |
| `uninit_chain_assign` | A chained or nested assignment initializes its targets; they are not read first. |
| `adt_layout` | ADT enum payload sizing: array fields, nested enums and generic instances must get enough payload slots, and a struct holding an enum by value must be sized... |
| `alloc_overflow` | Bump/Arena/Pool/FirstFit and the <sysheap> Heap reject huge or negative sizes instead of wrapping the size arithmetic, and a FirstFit buffer smaller than one region header holds nothing (no write past it). |
| `async_dowhile_defer` | do/while, defer and capturing lambdas inside async functions, around awaits. |
| `async_expr_rewrite` | Frame-hoisted locals used after an await inside every expression form: ++/--, a ternary, an array index, a struct literal, a slice, and a cast. |
| `async_local_named_fr` | A user local named `fr` in an async function must not collide with the transform's internal frame pointer. |
| `base64_strict` | base64_decode rejects impossible lengths and misplaced padding (it used to decode "Z" and "Z=g=" to something) while still accepting padded, unpadded, and... |
| `bitfield_incdec` | `++`/`--` on a bitfield is a masked read-modify-write of its storage word: it wraps within the field's width and never spills into the neighbouring fields. |
| `bitfield_layout` | Bitfields pack into storage words of their declared type (like C): uint8 fields share a byte, a uint64 field keeps all 64 bits, and a new word opens when... |
| `block_shadow` | A `let` in a nested block (or a for-init) shadows, not overwrites, an outer variable of the same name; the outer binding is visible again after the scope. |
| `bool_conversion` | Conversion to bool is `!= 0` (C _Bool semantics), never a truncation to the low bit. |
| `c_abi_struct` | Structs passed and returned BY VALUE across `extern` C functions follow the target C ABI (C side: tests/c_abi_struct.c): register-sized aggregates, HFAs,... (C companion `c_abi_struct.c`) |
| `c_abi_try` | C-ABI-lowered extern calls inside a `try` body (lowered to `invoke`), with the externs declared before the structs they take by value. (C companion `c_abi_try.c`) |
| `call_forms` | Generic inference from a struct-literal argument, and calling a returned closure directly (`pick()(3, 4)`). |
| `chained_assign` | A chained assignment passes on the value converted to the inner target's type. |
| `chan_free_waiter` | Chan_free detaches a still-parked receiver, so dropping that Chan_recv future afterwards no longer reads the freed channel. |
| `chan_recv_drop` | A parked Chan_recv dropped by select2 (the timeout pattern) must unpark: the next Chan_send buffers its value instead of completing the freed future. |
| `compound_assign_once` | `lv op= v` evaluates the lvalue `lv` exactly once (C semantics), even when it has side effects: an index call, a post-increment, or a call returning a pointer. |
| `defer_unbraced` | A statement body that is not a block (an unbraced if/else/loop body, a switch case, a match arm) is its own scope: a `defer` in it runs when that body ends,... |
| `deprecated_names` | The pre-0.9.2 stdlib names (renamed to the Type_method convention) still compile and behave as thin wrappers over the new names. |
| `dup_struct_decl` | The same struct declared twice (as when two inputs of a multi-file build share a header-style declaration): the duplicate is merged, not emitted a second time. |
| `env_get_int` | env_get_int returns the fallback for a set but non-numeric (or out-of-range) value, as documented, instead of atoi's 0. |
| `eventloop_edges` | el_new(0) grows its fd table instead of looping forever, replacing an fd's registration from outside its callback frees the old env, and EventLoop_free frees still-registered fds' envs. |
| `eventloop_resources` | EventLoop_free closes the kqueue/epoll descriptor (and Executor_free its self-pipe), so creating and freeing loops does not leak fds; and a full timer table... |
| `executor_many` | Executor_schedule coalesces wakes into one pending self-pipe byte (write end non-blocking), so 100000 wakers scheduled before the loop runs no longer block the scheduler. |
| `expr_types` | Static types of compound expressions: pointer arithmetic keeps the pointee type, numeric binaries promote, and a ternary takes its arms' common type. |
| `finally_catch_exit` | `finally` runs when a catch handler leaves early (return / break / continue), just as it does on fall-through and on an early exit from the try body. |
| `float_literal_range` | Float literals follow C: a denormal keeps its (tiny, nonzero) value, and a literal too large for double is infinity. |
| `forin_multidim` | for-in over a multidimensional array binds each row (an `int[3]` for `int[2][3]`). |
| `fs_read_pipe` | fs_read_all on a stream that cannot seek (a pipe, like stdin) must read to end of file instead of trusting ftell (-1 there), growing past its first guess. |
| `future_polled` | free_future_polled frees the resume closure a hand-driven future_poll installed along with the future (free_future leaves it, so a capturing resume leaked). |
| `generic_operators` | Operator overloads resolve inside a generic body, per instantiation. |
| `global_const_expr` | Global initializers are folded at compile time, operators included (C semantics). |
| `global_neg_const` | Negative constants in global initializers keep their sign, and a doubly negated literal folds to the positive value. |
| `heap_coalesce` | FirstFit (and the <sysheap> Heap over it) coalesces adjacent free regions: after 64 x 900-byte blocks are freed in any order, a 30000-byte allocation fits... |
| `hpack_evict_name` | RFC 7541 §4.4: a literal with incremental indexing may name a dynamic entry that its own insertion evicts. |
| `hpack_limits` | HPACK: the Huffman scratch arena is sized from the block (a valid 20000-byte value decodes), a table size update after a field is a COMPRESSION_ERROR, and more fields than the caller's array is -2 with the table kept in sync. |
| `hpack_size_update` | A §6.3 dynamic table size update above SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE is a COMPRESSION_ERROR (the decode fails) instead of growing the table past the entry... |
| `hpack_truncated` | Malformed HPACK blocks must fail cleanly (-1) without reading past the block: a string literal longer than the remaining bytes, a prefix integer whose... |
| `http2_big_headers` | Response headers larger than the old fixed 8 KB block are sized from the headers, and a block over MAX_FRAME_SIZE (16384) is split into a HEADERS frame plus... |
| `http2_flow_control` | h2c flow control with a window-honoring client thread: a 100000-byte upload gets WINDOW_UPDATE credit, a response waiting for window is not credited by another stream's update, and a request arriving meanwhile is decoded (HPACK in sync) and answered. |
| `http2_field_rules` | RFC 9113 §8.2.1: a request field with CR/LF/NUL or edge whitespace in its value, or an uppercase/space/colon in its name, is answered 400 without the handler (an LF used to forge a header line). |
| `http2_frame_rules` | h2c frame rules: PADDED DATA/HEADERS unpadded, CONTINUATION reassembled (interrupted = PROTOCOL_ERROR), PING answered, window overflow and bad SETTINGS are GOAWAY, over-long padding rejected, >64 header fields get 431 without the handler. |
| `http2_settings_values` | SETTINGS values are validated before any is applied (ENABLE_PUSH 0/1, MAX_FRAME_SIZE range, INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE at most 2^31 - 1), with the RFC 9113 error code from h2_settings_error. |
| `http2_stream_errors` | RST_STREAM on an idle stream is a PROTOCOL_ERROR GOAWAY, a GOAWAY under 8 bytes a FRAME_SIZE_ERROR, and a HEADERS/PRIORITY self-dependency a PROTOCOL_ERROR reset (its block still decoded, HPACK in sync). |
| `http2_tls_engine` | Both h2-over-TLS servers run the H2Server engine: padding, CONTINUATION, PING (async), >64 headers (431) and window overflow, over an OpenSSL stand-in (C companion `http2_tls_engine.c`). |
| `http_async_accept_retry` | The async servers retry a failed accept (EMFILE) after a backoff via net_accept_retry_async instead of spawning a handler on fd -1 that never completes the wait-group. |
| `http_header_edges` | HTTP/1.1 edge cases: header values lose surrounding whitespace (OWS), an overflowing or malformed Content-Length is a 400 (it used to wrap to 0),... |
| `http_reply_null_body` | `http_reply` with a null body sends Content-Length: 0 (it used to read body.len through the null pointer). |
| `http_strict` | HTTP/1.1 strictness: a body cut short by the peer is 400, conflicting Content-Length values are 400, a bare CR/LF in the head or an empty method/path is malformed (the servers answer 400 without the handler), and render sends a body past an embedded NUL. |
| `http_rfc9112` | RFC 9112 framing: a chunked body is decoded (extensions, trailers), TE with CL is 400, a non-chunked coding 501, whitespace before a colon, obs-fold, a missing or repeated Host in HTTP/1.1 and an invalid version 400, HTTP/2.0 505; same rules in `HttpRequest_parse` |
| `int_promotion` | C integer promotions: operands narrower than `int` (bool, char, int8/16, uint8/16) become `int` before arithmetic, bitwise, shift, and comparison. |
| `interface_values` | An interface value is a {data, vtable} fat pointer held by value: it can be a local, a struct field, a return value, or an argument, and it refers to a... |
| `json_builder_escape` | The JSON builder escapes control bytes (so its output parses back) and writes a full int64 instead of truncating it to 32 bits. |
| `json_depth` | json_parse rejects nesting past JSON_MAX_DEPTH (512) with null instead of overflowing the stack, and JsonValue_free frees a deep tree iteratively. |
| `json_strict` | json_parse is strict (RFC 8259) and never reads past the input: truncated escapes and literals fail cleanly, malformed literals / numbers and trailing... |
| `logical_not` | `!` on a pointer tests for null, on a float tests for 0.0, and a user `operator !(V)` resolves for a struct operand. |
| `loop_temps` | Expression temporaries (short-circuit slots, ternary slots, struct/ADT/closure temps) inside a long loop must not allocate stack space per iteration. |
| `map_hash_intmin` | A key whose djb2 hash is exactly 0x80000000 ("ovuga,m") must still land in a valid bucket: the signed `h = 0 - h` fold left INT_MIN negative, a negative... |
| `multipart_delimiters` | multipart: the boundary is parsed as a real (case-insensitive, whole-name, quotable) Content-Type parameter, and a delimiter counts only at the body start or after CRLF with its line ending in -- or CRLF. |
| `multipart_name_match` | multipart_part matches the `name` parameter only (not the tail of `filename="..."`), and a present-but-empty field is found with length 0. |
| `multipart_disposition` | `multipart_part` matches only the Content-Disposition `name` parameter (not a `name=` in Content-Type), case-insensitive header and parameter names, token or quoted values, exact value match |
| `nested_body_context` | A lambda body, or a generic first instantiated inside a `try`, is its own function: it never runs the enclosing function's defers, and never unwinds into... |
| `net_write_async` | net_write_async completes with the byte count and frees its progress counter on completion (it used to leak one per call; only the cancel path freed it). |
| `path_posix_edges` | POSIX dirname/basename edge cases: the root, empty paths, and repeated separators between the directory and the final component. |
| `ptr_diff` | Pointer difference counts elements (C), not bytes. |
| `range_bound_once` | A range loop's upper bound is evaluated once, before the first iteration. |
| `regex_class_range` | An invalid bracket range (`[z-a]`, `[a-\d]`, `[\d-z]`) is a compile error as in RE2; `\D` `\W` `\S` inside a class are the complemented shorthands (they used to be the literal letters). |
| `regex_depth` | regex_compile rejects group nesting past RE_MAX_DEPTH (512) with an error instead of overflowing the stack. |
| `regex_empty_iter` | A starred group that can match empty takes one empty iteration and exits, as in RE2 (`(a?\|b)*` on "b" is (0,0) with group 1 = (0,0)). |
| `regex_repeat_count` | A `{m,n}` count above 1000 is a compile error (RE2 limit); the digits used to wrap, so `a{4294967298}` compiled as `a{2}`. |
| `regex_repeat_groups` | Counted or repeated groups duplicate SAVE instructions; the Pike VM must still find the match (capture storage used to run out and report a silent no-match). |
| `rvalue_member` | Member access, indexing and method calls work on rvalue aggregates (call results, operator results, ternaries, fields of temporaries), not just on variables. |
| `self_append` | Appending a String or Bytes to itself must copy from the live buffer, not from the one freed when the append grows it. |
| `static_local_closure` | A `static` local has static storage: a closure refers to that one cell (like a global) rather than capturing a copy, and an uninitialized static starts at zero. |
| `stdlib_after_free` | A freed String or Map/HashMap is empty rather than a trap (clear, trim, at, get), String_substring clamps a negative start, and DateTime_to_epoch sums the time of day in 64 bits. |
| `string_int_edges` | String integer edge cases: INT_MIN renders fully (it used to print "-"), a zero-capacity String_init still has room for its NUL, String_to_int accepts a... |
| `struct_lit_zero_fill` | Fields a struct literal omits are zero-initialized (C semantics), at -O0 and -O2. |
| `switch_case_fold` | Case values fold to integer constants: literals, chars, enum members, casts and arithmetic over them. |
| `switch_const_case` | A top-level `const int` (or a constant expression over one) is a valid case label. |
| `ternary_null` | A `null` ternary arm takes the other arm's pointer type. |
| `ternary_wide` | A ternary arm that is an integer literal too wide for `int` makes the result 64-bit, and equal-width mixed signedness is unsigned (C usual arithmetic... |
| `time_negative_year` | DateTime_format_iso prints a negative (proleptic) year in ISO 8601 expanded form, "-0001", instead of zero-padding the digits around the sign ("00-1"). |
| `tls_alpn_bounds` | tls_alpn_pick_h2 stops at an ALPN entry whose length runs past the list instead of reading beyond the buffer. |
| `tls_frame_limit` | A peer-controlled 24-bit frame length larger than the 16384-byte frame buffer must be rejected (FRAME_SIZE_ERROR), not read past the buffer. |
| `union_layout` | A union takes the alignment of its most-aligned member, so it lands at the C offset inside a struct and the struct is padded like C (u at 8, size 24). |
| `async_name_collisions` | Locals and parameters named like the async transform's synthesized names (`__fr`, `st`, `ret`, `awaiting`, the await temporaries, the resume function) do not collide with them. |
| `async_range_wide` | An await inside a range loop over `int64` bounds keeps the hoisted loop variable `int64`. |
| `bitfield_c_layout` | Bitfields follow the target's C layout (C side: `bitfield_c_layout.c`): mixed declared types share a storage unit when they fit (SysV/AAPCS), packed structs pack bit by bit; C writes, Eskiu reads, and back. |
| `c_abi_callback` | An Eskiu function passed to C as `(*void)f` that takes or returns a struct by value is reached through a C-ABI thunk (C side: `c_abi_callback.c`). |
| `c_abi_fnptr` | An `extern` fn-typed parameter is a C function pointer: a top-level function is passed by its C address (through a thunk for by-value structs), `null` as a null pointer, and libc `qsort` takes its comparator that way (C side: `c_abi_fnptr.c`). |
| `const_fold_c` | Constant initializers compute what the same expression computes at run time (promotions, usual arithmetic conversions, sign-extending casts, wrapping). |
| `const_ptr_method` | A method on `const P* self` is callable through a pointer to const. |
| `const_sizeof_struct` | A top-level `const` using `sizeof(struct)` folds to the real size. |
| `defer_block_body` | A braced defer body run on an early exit does not invalidate the frame being unwound. |
| `defer_shadow` | A deferred statement names the variables visible where it was written, even when it runs where a later declaration shadows one. |
| `defer_switch_continue` | `continue` of a loop inside a `switch` case runs only the loop body's defers. |
| `exceptions_nolib` | A program that throws links with no `-l` flag (the driver adds the C++ runtime). |
| `extern_defined_struct` | An `extern` prototype next to the program's own definition keeps the Eskiu convention. |
| `fn_type_local` | A C-style local of function type, `fn(int32)->int32 h = f;`, parses. |
| `generic_arith_type` | Built-in operators in a generic body get the instance's types (unsigned division and comparison stay unsigned). |
| `generic_const_self` | A generic `Type_method` taking `const Box<T>* self` infers `T` through a const receiver. |
| `generic_dot_call` | `x.m(args)` on a generic instance calls the generic `S_m<T..>` with the receiver's type arguments (`List`, `Map`, `HashMap`, `Chan`, and inside generic bodies). |
| `generic_infer_multi` | One parameter carrying several type parameters binds them all (`Pair<A, B>`, `HashMap_get(&m, k, &out)`). |
| `generic_struct_methods` | Inline methods on a generic struct, instantiated per struct instance. |
| `http_int64_lengths` | `Content-Length` digits are written from an `int64`, so values above `INT_MAX` come out in full. |
| `int_conversions_c` | C's usual arithmetic conversions: same-width signed/unsigned is unsigned, a shift takes its left operand's type, unary `-`/`~` promote. |
| `literal_unsigned_mix` | A literal mixed with an unsigned operand follows C's conversions; a char literal is unsigned. |
| `main_int32` | `int32 main()` is a valid entry point. |
| `math_nolib` | `import <math>` links with no `-l` flag (`#pragma link("m")` on glibc). |
| `pragma_link` | `#pragma link("name")` links `-lname`: repeated pragmas link once, an import's pragma counts, one in a skipped `#ifdef` branch does not. |
| `range_bound_outer` | Range bounds are read in the enclosing scope: a bound naming the loop variable means the outer one. |
| `range_end_name` | The range loop's synthesized bound local does not capture a user variable spelled `__end_i`. |
| `range_for_wide` | The range loop variable takes the bounds' common integer type, so `int64`/`uint64` bounds are not truncated. |
| `shadow_init` | A shadowing declaration's initializer reads the outer variable. |
| `sizeof_mixed_sign` | `sizeof` is an `int64` in mixed-sign arithmetic. |
| `ternary_narrow_arms` | Two different narrow ternary arms meet as `int`. |
| `wide_literal_type` | An integer literal too wide for `int` is an `int64` and widens its operation. |
| `array_2d` | multidimensional `int[N][M]` in C order: the leftmost bracket is the outer dimension |
| `async_await_var` | awaiting a future held in a variable takes its type from the `let` declaration |
| `bytes` | `<bytes>`: embedded NUL survives, append/eq/slice, base64 round trip |
| `closure_coerce` | a closure call widens an argument narrower than its parameter |
| `comment_backslash_continuation` | a `//` comment ending in `\` does not splice the next line into the comment |
| `crlf_source` | CRLF line endings: backslash continuation, directives and `__LINE__` keep the right line numbers |
| `datetime` | `<time>` UTC civil calendar: split, format and round trip |
| `dead_code_return` | code after a `return` is dropped instead of emitted into a terminated block |
| `defer` | `defer` runs LIFO at block exit on fall-through, `return`, `break`, `continue` and `?` |
| `enum_match` | `match` on a payload-less enum: exhaustive dispatch, explicit `= N` values, `_` default |
| `errdefer` | `errdefer` runs only on a `?`-propagation exit; plain `defer` always runs |
| `escapes` | string and char escapes share one set; `\0` is NUL and char literals accept `\r` |
| `escapes_hex` | `\xNN` hex escapes in string and char literals decode to the exact bytes |
| `float_arg_coerce` | a `double` literal passed to a `float` parameter narrows at the call site |
| `float_exponent` | scientific-notation float literals (`3.4e38`, `2.5e-3`, `1e6`, `6.022e+23`) |
| `global_array_init` | global and static-local initializers, including array literals, survive to load time |
| `global_const_init` | global and static initializers fold every constant form (64-bit, struct, const/enum/sizeof, `~`/`!`, string, hex) |
| `global_lambda` | a non-capturing lambda assigned to a global folds to a constant closure |
| `iface_arg_coerce` | interface (vtable) dispatch coerces each argument to the method's parameter type |
| `import_dedup` | imports are deduplicated by canonical path, and an import cycle does not re-parse the root |
| `labeled_break` | `break label` / `continue label` target a named loop and unwind the defers they leave |
| `long_chain` | precedence climbing: equal-precedence operators fold left, long mixed chains follow C precedence |
| `loop_locals` | a long loop with several locals does not grow the stack (allocas live in the entry block) |
| `map` | `Map<V>` string-keyed hash map with growth and struct values |
| `map_generic` | `HashMap<K,V>` with fn-pointer hash/eq, int keys (with growth) and struct keys |
| `method_call_args` | a dot-call converts each argument, returns a large struct through sret, and throws through a `try` |
| `multipart` | `multipart_part` extracts the "photo" part from a form-data body |
| `numeric_signedness` | C signed/unsigned rules: `fptoui`, `>>` follows the left operand, mixed-rank ops |
| `octal_literal` | leading-zero integer literals are octal (C rule) |
| `operators` | operator overloading: binary, overloads by operand type, comparison, unary, subscript, compound assign |
| `paren_deref` | `(*p)` is a dereference expression, not a cast; `(*T)x` stays a cast when T is a type |
| `pointer_array` | `*T[N]` is an array of N pointers, at module scope and as a local |
| `pp_macro_args` | function-like macro arguments: literals stay whole, nested calls expand first, block-comment apostrophes are ignored |
| `random` | `<random>` xoshiro256** stream from a fixed seed (regression golden) |
| `regex` | `<regex>` Thompson NFA / Pike VM syntax and capture groups |
| `short_circuit` | `&&` / `\|\|` evaluate the right operand only when needed |
| `slice` | slice `T[]` fat pointer: carries its length and aliases the backing array |
| `slice_empty_end` | an empty slice `s[len..len]` at the end is valid; a mid slice reads the right element |
| `slice_ptr` | `ptr[lo..hi]` builds a slice over heap memory |
| `sort` | `<sort>` generic heapsort and binary search |
| `static_const_init` | `static` locals accept array, cast and negative constant initializers and persist across calls |
| `static_local` | a `static` local keeps one instance across calls |
| `switch_defer_bitfield` | a `break` in a `switch` runs only the switch's cleanups; a bitfield write through `*Struct` reaches the pointee |
| `template_rshift_backtrack` | `x < y >> 1` parses as `x < (y >> 1)` after the template-call attempt backtracks |
| `ternary` | `?:` evaluates one arm and coexists with postfix `?` propagation |
| `test_modes_macros` | the single-file `--test-*` modes predefine the same macros as a build |

| `bitfield_bool` | `bool` bitfields at nonzero bit offsets, set, cleared and brace-initialized |
| `bitfield_enum_c` | `bool` and enum bitfields agree with the C layout and signedness (C companion) |
| `for_in_once` | `for (x in E)` evaluates a call, a variable-index element or a pointer-returning call once (sync and async) |
| `alias_operands` | operators on alias-typed fields, elements, returns and pointees |
| `thread_handles` | `thread_create` of a lambda, a function and a closure value; `thread_join` of a field or `?*void` |
| `async_await_struct` | awaiting futures of a struct, a generic instance and a `join2v` pair |
| `alloc_with_method` | `alloc_with` over an inline `alloc` method, through a pointer, with an alias count; a string slices to `char[]` |
| `ptr_sub_same` | `p - q` across `const`, `?` and alias spellings of the same pointer type |

### `smoke` tests (compile + link + exit 0)

## Previously known issues (now fixed, and guarded by tests)

Two real compiler bugs were found while building this suite. Both are now fixed and
covered by exact-match `run` tests, so a regression would fail `run.sh`.

1. **`union` float member store**: *fixed.* `v.f = 3.14` stored the full 8-byte
   double into the union's offset-0 storage without truncating to `float`, so a
   later read got garbage (`126443839488.0`). The assignment path now coerces the
   RHS to the LHS member's declared scalar type. Guarded by `sizeof_union_ptr.esk`.

2. **No forward function resolution**: *fixed.* Codegen emitted functions in source
   order, so a call to a function defined later (or a `int b(int n);` forward
   declaration) failed with `Undefined variable or function`. Codegen now declares
   all prototypes in a pre-pass before emitting bodies, enabling call-before-define
   and mutual recursion. Guarded by `forward_decl.esk`.

## Fuzzers

The fuzzers live in `tests/fuzz/`. Each run is deterministic for a given `--seed`, writes
what it finds to `tests/fuzz/findings/` (ignored by git), and exits non-zero when it finds
anything. Every compiler and program invocation runs under a timeout and a 4 GB resident
memory cap (`fuzz_util.py`), and a timeout or blowup counts as a finding. Parallel work is
limited to 4 jobs by default (`--jobs`).

**`eskiu_fuzz.py`** has two parts.

- The mutation and generation loop (`--iterations N`) feeds programs to `eskiuc` and
  reports crashes, IR verifier failures, hangs, and programs whose output differs between
  `-O0` and `-O2`.
- The C oracle (`--oracle N`, module `c_oracle.py`) generates programs inside a
  C-translatable subset of Eskiu: integers of every width and signedness, `bool` and
  `char`, casts, arithmetic, bitwise, shift and comparison operators, the ternary,
  `if`/`while`/`for`/`do`/`switch`/`break`/`continue`, nested blocks that shadow outer
  names, arrays, structs, pointers and pointer difference, pure and side-effecting
  functions, globals with constant initializers, `static` locals and `defer`. Each
  program is also emitted as C, built with `clang -O0 -fwrapv`, and the C++ `eskiuc` (at
  `-O0` and `-O2`) and the self-hosted `eskiuc-esk` must print exactly what it prints.
  This is the only check outside the Eskiu compilers, so it catches a bug both compilers
  share. Undefined behavior is avoided the same way on both sides (divisors and shift
  counts are guarded, indices masked, side effects kept where C fixes the order); `defer`
  has no C counterpart, so the C side runs the deferred statements at every exit.

```bash
python3 tests/fuzz/eskiu_fuzz.py --iterations 300 --seed 1           # mutation loop
python3 tests/fuzz/eskiu_fuzz.py --oracle-only --oracle 200 --seed 1 # the CI oracle gate
python3 tests/fuzz/eskiu_fuzz.py --oracle-only --oracle 20000 --seed 5   # a long run
python3 tests/fuzz/eskiu_fuzz.py --oracle-repro 5:1234    # print one program (Eskiu + C)
python3 tests/fuzz/eskiu_fuzz.py --oracle-reduce 5:1234   # shrink a finding
```

A finding is named `oracle_<build>-<kind>_<seed>_<index>` (for example
`oracle_self-diff_5_1234.esk` with its `.c` twin); `--oracle-reduce` deletes lines and
whole blocks while the finding still reproduces and writes `reduced_<seed>_<index>.*`.
Set `ESKIU_CLANG` to the clang to use, and `ESKIUC_ESK` if the self-hosted compiler is
not at `build/eskiuc-esk` (it is skipped when missing).

**`neg_fuzz.py`** is the negative corpus. It takes a program from the C-oracle generator
and injects exactly one error (about sixty kinds: undefined names, members of scalars,
bad calls and argument types, operators on structs or strings, bad casts, assigning to
an rvalue or a const, stray `break`/`continue`, duplicate locals and parameters,
out-of-range literals, division by a literal zero, unknown types, bad struct and array
literals, duplicate or non-constant `case` labels, non-constant globals and statics,
missing returns, unchecked `?*T` derefs, and more) at a random point of the program. Both
compilers must reject it without crashing, with an `error: file:line:col:` diagnostic on
the line of the injected error. Findings are `neg_<build>-<kind>_<seed>_<index>.esk`
(ACCEPT, CRASH, HANG, UNLOCATED, LOCATION).

```bash
python3 tests/fuzz/neg_fuzz.py --programs 300 --seed 1     # the CI gate
python3 tests/fuzz/neg_fuzz.py --programs 20000 --seed 7   # a long run
python3 tests/fuzz/neg_fuzz.py --repro 7:123               # print one program
```

**`stdlib_fuzz.py`** fuzzes the stdlib parsers under AddressSanitizer. Each target in
`tests/fuzz/stdlib/` (`json`, `base64`, `url`, `regex`, `hpack`, `http`, `multipart`,
`uuid_time`) is an Eskiu program built with `eskiuc --asan` that reads a batch of inputs
and runs them through the parser, checking round trips where there is one (base64 and
url encode/decode, hpack encode/decode, epoch/calendar conversion). The driver mutates a
seed corpus (hand-written seeds plus string literals from the matching tests) and fails
on a crash, an ASan report, a broken invariant, a hang or a memory blowup, saving the
input to `stdlib_<target>_<seed>_<n>.bin`.

```bash
python3 tests/fuzz/stdlib_fuzz.py --inputs 1500 --seed 1   # the CI gate (a few seconds a target)
python3 tests/fuzz/stdlib_fuzz.py --seconds 300 --seed 7   # five minutes per target
python3 tests/fuzz/stdlib_fuzz.py --targets hpack --replay tests/fuzz/findings/x.bin
```

## Adding a test

- **Positive, deterministic output:** add `NAME.esk` and `NAME.expected` (the exact
  stdout). Generate the expected file from a *known-correct* run, then read it to
  confirm it is right before committing.
- **Positive, non-deterministic / smoke only:** add `NAME.esk` with no `.expected`.
- **Negative:** add `errors/NAME.esk` whose first line is
  `// EXPECT-ERROR: <substring of the diagnostic>`.
- **Lint:** add `warnings/NAME.esk` with one `// EXPECT-WARNING: <substring>` line per
  expected `-Wall` warning (no such line means the file must produce no warning).
