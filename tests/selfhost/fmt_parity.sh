# `fmt` parity gate for the self-hosted compiler driver (selfhost/esk_main.esk).
#
# For every source file in the corpus, format a copy with the C++ `eskiuc fmt` and
# another copy with the self-hosted `esk_main fmt`, then diff. The self-host formatter
# must be BYTE-identical to the C++ one everywhere. Because the C++ formatter is
# idempotent, byte-equality here means the self-host formatter is idempotent too.
#
# Usage: tests/selfhost/fmt_parity.sh [file.esk ...]
#   no args -> stdlib/ + selfhost/ + tests/ + examples/ (the whole in-repo corpus)
# Green (exit 0) = identical formatting for every file.
