# Parity gate for the self-hosted parser (selfhost/parser.esk) vs the C++ parser.
#
# The Eskiu driver is compiled once to a native binary, then run per file. For each
# file we run BOTH parsers, strip the C++ `--test-parser` banner, and raw-`diff` the
# AST dumps (the Eskiu driver prints the dump in the exact ast_printer.cpp format).
# Byte-identical = parity.
#
# Usage: tests/selfhost/parse_parity.sh [file.esk ...]
#   no args   -> the synthetic corpus under tests/selfhost/parse_inputs/
#   --full    -> the real corpus tests/*.esk. The self-hosted parser now follows
#                `import` (resolving <stdlib> + relative paths, recursively), so the
#                only files it can't match are those whose transitive import closure
#                touches a stream-rewriting preprocessor directive / built-in macro /
#                shebang — the preprocessor isn't self-hosted yet, so the C++ token
#                stream would differ. A file is excluded iff ANY file in its closure
#                (itself + everything it imports) has such a directive.
# Green (exit 0) = byte-identical AST dumps for every file.
