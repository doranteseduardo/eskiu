# -O0 vs -O2 behavioral differential.
#
# Every tests/*.esk must produce an identical exit code + stdout whether compiled at
# -O0 (naive IR straight to the backend) or -O2 (the LLVM middle-end pipeline the `-O`
# flag runs). A divergence means the optimizer miscompiled the program — i.e. the
# front-end emitted IR that is wrong in a way -O0 tolerates but -O2 exploits (a bad
# attribute, a type/ABI mismatch, UB, ...). This is the gate that caught the
# float-closure return-type miscompile (see CHANGELOG 0.3.1).
#
# Files that don't compile+link standalone (need extra link libs) are skipped and
# counted. A few known-flaky async server tests are skipped explicitly (their codegen
# is covered by tests/run.sh); running them here would import their flakiness.
#
# Usage: [ESKIUC=path] [CC=clang-22] tests/opt_differential.sh
# Green (exit 0) = every compiled program behaves identically at -O0 and -O2.
